This project aims to offer virtual, 3 dimensional models of diagrams in NCERT science textbooks, in use by our school.

A smartphone camera scans the diagram and loads a model on the screen, over the diagram that the user can zoom into and interact with. This makes complex concepts easy to understand.

This will enhance the learning capacity of students in India as learning will be more interactive and easier to understand.
